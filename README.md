# Taisti Documentation

## Introduction

Welcome to the Taisti documentation! Taisti (Tatra AI - Start Investing) is a beginner-friendly investment app designed to empower users to start their investing journey with confidence. This documentation provides an overview of Taisti's features, architecture, and how to get started with the app.

## Technologies Used

During the development of Taisti, we utilized a variety of open-source technologies to create a seamless user experience. These technologies include:

-   **React Native**: We chose React Native for its cross-platform compatibility and ease of development, allowing us to build a mobile app that works on both iOS and Android devices.
-   **Firebase**: Firebase provides a comprehensive suite of tools for building mobile and web applications, including authentication, real-time database, and cloud storage. We leveraged Firebase for user authentication, data storage, and real-time updates.

-   **Open-source AI Models**: Taisti integrates open-source AI models to provide personalized recommendations and insights tailored to each user's preferences and goals. These models help enhance the user experience by delivering relevant content and guidance.

## Architecture Overview

Taisti follows a client-server architecture, with the mobile app built using React Native as the client and Firebase serving as the backend infrastructure. The app communicates with the Firebase backend to authenticate users, store and retrieve data, and provide real-time updates.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the Taisti repository from GitHub to your local machine.
2. **Install Dependencies**: Navigate to the project directory and run `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies.
